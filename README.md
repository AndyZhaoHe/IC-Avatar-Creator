# Quick Start
For Internet Computer support you will need to install dfx and run "dfx deploy" after installing node_modules but before running npm run dev. You can get more information on setting dfx up [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/ic-overview)

```
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://smartcontracts.org/install.sh)"
npm install
dfx deploy
npm run dev
```
